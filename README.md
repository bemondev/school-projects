# Introduction
Hi, my name is Bernardo and I'm an IT student from Uruguay. Welcome to my repository.

## What is this?
This is a little portfolio I made compiling some of the works I've been doing throught my degree in IT. 

## Why?
It's an easy way to show and share some of the stuff I've been learning and implementing. I've been dabbling into a couple areas of IT for the last couple years: Front and Backend development, Testing, Databases, Infrastructure and Cloud.

# Sections
This project is divided into different folders, each being a different programming language / area. If you see a title with kebab-case that mean's it's a project ready to launch.

## Java
Consists mainly of JakartaEE Servers for backend and has a frontend app.

## Kotlin
Consists of different android mobile apps.

## Web Development
Websites to run on a browser or deploy.

# Final words
Thanks for checking out my portfolio :) I'll keep adding to it from time to time and try to keep it up to date!
